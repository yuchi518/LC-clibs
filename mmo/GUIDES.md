# **mmo** library guides

**mmo** library is an objective architecture, it supports many objective features in runtime, such as runtime type
casting (recognizing), virtual functions, etc. Many languages (ex, C++, Obj-C) had support these features and had more powerful
features, but sometimes we just want to use C language to implement portable projects easily.
